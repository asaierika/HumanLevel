# HumanLevel

##Game Synopsis 
You are a fox and your bestie is a young boy from a family of farmers. Unfortunately, their harvest is extremely poor this year, allegedly because some bandits destroyed the Inari shrine of the region angering the god. The boy is at risk of being taken as a slave by the local landlord, shall the harvest not improve the coming year. This leads you to set on a journey to find Inari. Your goal is to gather the necessary offerings to appease the Kami Inari.

##Game mechanism 
There are two phases in the game. The first phase is set in the human realm. Here you can assume human form in the day but must revert to animal form at night. You will need to infiltrate the estates of nobles and steal certain prized treasures as offerings. Such quests will have two parts. The first part will be set in the day. In human form, you will pick up clues, obtain help from people and plan your route. The second part will be set at night. In animal form, you will use the information gathered during the day to evade detection and reach the offering. 

After gathering all the required offerings from the human realm, you will be guided by a hare into the demi-human realm and enter the second phase of the game.

The demi-human realm used to be populated by both fairies and demi-humans, but now fairies are scarce and few. Here, you can switch freely between demi-human and spirit form. Offerings are hidden at challenging locations in the wilderness. You will visit the merchant to obtain information on these places. After which, you will seek a companion to embark on the quest with you (eg. A sparrow might be a good partner if the terrain involves valleys and cliffs). Spirit form will be useful as it allows you to see fairy markings and work out the steps to solve relevant puzzles you will encounter. 

When all the offerings are gathered, there will be a cutscene of which you will be led to visit the kami Inari in the arc spirit realm. This appeases her and brings back the much awaited rain back to the farmlands.
